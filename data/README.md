# Data Directory

This directory contains data files used and generated by the GitHub Event Intelligence Pipeline.

## Directory Structure

- **external/**: External data sources and reference files
- **processed/**: Data files processed through the pipeline

## Data Sources

The primary data source for this project is GitHub Archive (GHArchive), which provides public GitHub timeline data in JSON format. The data is typically downloaded as `.json.gz` compressed files.

## Data Storage

While the initial data download may be stored in this directory, the production pipeline stores:
- Raw data in AWS S3
- Processed data in Snowflake

## Data Lifecycle

1. Raw GitHub Archive data (`.json.gz` files) are downloaded
2. Files are uploaded to S3 for storage
3. Data is processed through the Medallion Architecture:
   - Bronze: Raw data with minimal processing
   - Silver: Cleaned and normalized data
   - Gold: Business-level aggregations

## Notes

- This directory may contain sample data for development and testing
- For production use, data should be stored in S3 and Snowflake
- The `processed_files.txt` file tracks which data files have been processed
